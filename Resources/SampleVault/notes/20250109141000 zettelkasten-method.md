# Zettelkasten Method

The Zettelkasten method is a personal knowledge management system that uses interconnected notes to build a "second brain."

## Core Principles

1. **Atomic Notes**: Each note contains one idea
2. **Unique IDs**: Every note has a permanent identifier
3. **Linking**: Notes are connected through links
4. **No Hierarchy**: Knowledge emerges from connections

## Benefits

- **Serendipitous Discovery**: Find unexpected connections
- **Compound Knowledge**: Ideas build upon each other
- **External Memory**: Offload thinking to the system
- **Creative Insights**: New ideas emerge from links

## Implementation in hypenote

This app implements the Zettelkasten method with:

- Timestamp-based IDs (`yyyymmddhhmmss`)
- Wikilink syntax `[[Note Title]]`
- Automatic backlink detection
- Visual graph of connections
